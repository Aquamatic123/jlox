# Interpreter written in Java
This project is based on the book Crafting Interpreters written by Robert Nystrom

Jlox is a high level interpreter that scans source code, parses it into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and executes in using the visitor pattern.

to try it out, just clone the project and run make run.

this readme will be improved. this is just a placeholder.
